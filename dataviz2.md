# Comparing the Visualizations
When looking at these visualizations, they are referring to the same set of data.  Therefore, these data visualizations have similarities.  They appear different however, and can bring attention to different factors depending on the audience.  For example, the line graphs show a very clear image where one can identify which countries have shown the greatest upward trajectories in their debt over time.  The line charts also clearly show major hills or valleys in the data, which can then be tied to the year and context of that country.  The first graphic however, showcases which countries stand out with the worst debt to GDP ratios and only focuses on one given year for all countries.
In the third visualization, the column charts very clearly paint a picture of what comes under the curve, so to speak.  The highlighted feature of this vizualization is not necessarily the numerical total of spending, but a true visualization of how much of the GDP that amount is.  Seeing the lines in visualization one may be easier to forget the severity or gravity of the situation when it comes to national debts and GDP ratios.  By filling in those areas under the curve in the third visualization, it becomes more apparent just how much GDP is being taken up by debt.  
The graphs do show similarities, however.  The last two showcase countries in which data has not been available until recent years.  This provides some context in terms of why their numbers may appear vastly different from other nations.  Also, the visualizations capture the overall trends when looking at which countries are facing rising debt and which are not.  Because of the ability of visualization three to not only capture what countries are facing the highest debt to GDP ratios but also provide the clear context around the severity of those issues, it is the best choice for this data set.
