## In-Class Assignments

Here are some of the visualizations I completed in class as part of learning exercises:
- [Covid Cases](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/page2.md)
- [Generalizing Gov't Debt](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/dataviz2.md)

## Homework Assignments

Here are some of the assignments that I worked on for this course.  The first assignment was to take an existing visualization and improve it.  As a former educator from Cleveland, housing policy in Cleveland was a topic of interest for me since it affected my students.  I found the visualization on [this link](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/test1.jpg) and recreated it to focus more on the story of racial bias in evictions.
