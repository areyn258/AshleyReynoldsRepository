## In-Class Assignments

Here are some of the visualizations I completed in class as part of learning exercises:
- [Covid Cases](https://areyn258.github.io/AshleyReynoldsRepository/page2.html)
- [Generalizing Gov't Debt](https://areyn258.github.io/AshleyReynoldsRepository/dataviz2.html)

## Homework Assignments

Here are some of the assignments that I worked on for this course.  The first assignment was to take an existing visualization and improve it.  As a former educator from Cleveland, housing policy in Cleveland was a topic of interest for me since it affected my students.  I found the visualization on [this link](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/test1.jpg) and recreated it to focus more on the story of racial bias in evictions.  The process required a [rough draft](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/IMG_2606.jpg) of our visuals and then a final product.

## Final Project 

### Part One

The final project of this course consisted of multiple parts that came together to create the final website.  The first portion of this project focused on creating a call to action, [a story arc](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/Story%20arc%201.jpg), and identifying the [data](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/Broadband%20Availability%20map%20data.zip) available for our use.  Here is the finished [part one](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/final_project_AshleyReynolds.md) of my assignment.

### Part Two

For part two of the project, we focused on creating [wireframes](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/Sketches%202.jpg) and [sketches](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/Sketches%201.jpg) of our visualizations that we would like to include in our final presentation.  We also conducted an intentional round of user research, where we conducted interviews on the efficacy of our story and visuals thusfar.  Here is the finished [part two](https://github.com/areyn258/AshleyReynoldsRepository/blob/main/Final_Project_Part2.md) of my assignment.
