# Project Outline

For this project, I seek to explore a topic that COVID-19 has brought front and center in American education policy - equitable broadband access.  The goal of this project is to not only showcase who has broadband access and who does not, but also to explore the racial and socioeconmic biases this issue presents.  Furthermore, it will analyze the potential long term effects this issue brings for this generation of students and propose action steps for community members to take to help solve this crisis.

# Story Arc

For the story arc of this project, I am going to focus on the emotional response of my audience and guiding them through the precise phases of emotions that will best lead to a strong call to action.  At the beginning, I will focus on the benefits of education and how, pre-COVID, children were in schools, learning and happy.  Then, as emotions become more stark and serious, I will discuss how COVID shifted education to the home and the challenge of virtual learning for everyone.  At this point, that brings me to my first BIG question:  what if you didn't have internet or a device for your child to learn on?  Through this emotional middle section of the presentation, I will use data visualization to showcase the lack of broadband and technology access across the nation.  Furthermore, I will discuss the long-term impacts this may have on student achievement.  For the end of the presentation, I will bring the audience's emotions from stressed and frustrated to motivated through a discussion of resources and action steps that anyone can take to help get children equitable access to a COVID education.

Here is my draft of my story arc:

# The Data

There are two main data sets I hope to use for this project.  The first is a CSV file containing data on broadband accessibility for the U.S. broken down by rural and urban areas.  The second will cover the rest of my major points, including how many people don't have access to a computer or internet to complete online learning, their racial makeup, and their socioeconomic status.  

As a note, this links to a zip file because the map data file was so large.

# Method and Medium

The medium I plan on utilizing to create this final project is shorthand .  This will serve as the basis through which I am able to lay out my story in the flow mentioned in my story arc section.  For data visualizations, I plan to use ArcGIS to create the map of broadband availability.  For this, I will need to also download other files that will help provide some clarity to the map.  For the other visualizations, I will be utilizing primarily Flourish.  These visualizations include the amount of households without broadband access, the racial breakdown of households without broadband access, and the socioeconomic breakdown of households without broadband access.  I will also be creating visuals around the long-term impacts that this lack of access will create for students.  These visualizations will also be done in Flourish, likely, although I may use Tableau for these to try another software.  The last section of graphics or visualizations I will be creating for this project will be a basic visual such as a table or use some iconography to present the information on agencies and nonprofits working to get more households connected for virtual learning.

The method for the project follows the basic outline presented in the story arc, where I begin by discussing the background of the issue around connectivity by discussing how it was barely discussed pre-COVID.  Then, I will transition to the COVID era and discuss the transition to virtual learning and the frustrations that districts, parents, and students faced in getting connected.  After that, I will discuss the bulk of the material and visualizations surrounding lack of access and the various subgroups affected most.  Once that data has been presented clearly, I will discuss long-term impacts on student learning and then close with the call to action for community members to reach out and support organizations working to get students connected to the virtual classroom.
