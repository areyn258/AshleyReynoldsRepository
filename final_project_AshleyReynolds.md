# Project Outline

For this project, I seek to explore a topic that COVID-19 has brought front and center in American education policy - equitable broadband access.  The goal of this project is to not only showcase who has broadband access and who does not, but also to explore the racial and socioeconmic biases this issue presents.  Furthermore, it will analyze the potential long term effects this issue brings for this generation of students and propose action steps for community members to take to help solve this crisis.

# The Data

There are two main data sets I hope to use for this project.  The first is a CSV file containing data on broadband accessibility for the U.S. broken down by rural and urban areas.  The second will cover the rest of my major points, including how many people don't have access to a computer or internet to complete online learning, their racial makeup, and their socioeconomic status.
