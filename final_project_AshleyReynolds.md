# Project Outline

For this project, I seek to explore a topic that COVID-19 has brought front and center in American education policy - equitable broadband access.  The goal of this project is to not only showcase who has broadband access and who does not, but also to explore the racial and socioeconmic biases this issue presents.  Furthermore, it will analyze the potential long term effects this issue brings for this generation of students and propose action steps for community members to take to help solve this crisis.

# Story Arc

For the story arc of this project, I am going to focus on the emotional response of my audience and guiding them through the precise phases of emotions that will best lead to a strong call to action.  At the beginning, I will focus on the benefits of education and how, pre-COVID, children were in schools, learning and happy.  Then, as emotions become more stark and serious, I will discuss how COVID shifted education to the home and the challenge of virtual learning for everyone.  At this point, that brings me to my first BIG question:  what if you didn't have internet or a device for your child to learn on?  Through this emotional middle section of the presentation, I will use data visualization to showcase the lack of broadband and technology access across the nation.  Furthermore, I will discuss the long-term impacts this may have on student achievement.  For the end of the presentation, I will bring the audience's emotions from stressed and frustrated to motivated through a discussion of resources and action steps that anyone can take to help get children equitable access to a COVID education.

Here is my draft of my story arc:

# The Data

There are two main data sets I hope to use for this project.  The first is a CSV file containing data on broadband accessibility for the U.S. broken down by rural and urban areas.  The second will cover the rest of my major points, including how many people don't have access to a computer or internet to complete online learning, their racial makeup, and their socioeconomic status.  

As a note, this links to a zip file because the map data file was so large.
