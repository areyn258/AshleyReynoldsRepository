# Wireframes and Storyboard

Here is a link to my draft wireframes and storyboard so far from Shorthand.  This serves as my draft for the final project which will undergo continuous revision until next week.

# User Research Model and Results

## Target Audience

For my project, my target audience would be to any general community members who would like to learn more about this issue.  These could be parents, family members, general community members, community leaders, or educators.

## Approach to Identifying Interviewees

Luckily, my fiance is a data analytics student here at Heinz, so I always am eager for his input on my data projects due to his knowledge of data visualization and analysis.  I also decided to reach out to a close friend from Pittsburgh who I went to college with.  We both studied Political Science and she is familiar with my education policy passion but since she's outside my typical conversations about school I thought she would provide a good outside perspective.  Lastly, I chose my mom because she is someone who does not have any experience with this kind of data or visualization and she was also pretty unaware of the topic or problem at all.  She did not have as much detailed feedback but she gave me a good idea of what someone who has no idea what this topic is would think of the presentation.

## Interview Script

For my interview script, due to COVID, I emailed all of my interviewees my previewed website and the following questions:

- Who do you think the target audience is for this website?
- What was the main takeaway you had after seeing this?
- Was the story easy to understand?
- Are there any ways I can improve any holes in the story or make the charts easier to understand?

## Interview Findings

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the flow of the story seemed to be easy to follow, even for the people who were less familiar with the topic or at least the scope of the problem.

Additionally, it appeared that my target audience was coming through pretty well - although one person said "someone with a lot of money who can solve these problems" which is not entirely untrue, just not the main focus of my target audience.

As far as the takeaways, the three interviewees all seemed to grasp the idea that racial inequity in education is just as bad, if not worse now because of Covid.  Only one person mentioned the lasting impacts though, which is a key part of the story to me.  They said "the gap in virtual learning is drastically leaving students behind".  I would like to be more clear on the importance of the impacts moving forward.

Lastly, for ways to improve, I was relatively unsurprised that both of the interviewees with little dataviz experience said everything looked good and they were sure it would all be great once it's put together.  The other interviewee mentioned some criticism though, stating that I should consider different types of charts to increase variety in the presentation, such as "stacked bar charts or even combining racial/income groups instead of having them spread across availability.  The income graph was hard to interpret.  Try some more advanced plots like a treemap."

## Changes For the Future Iterations

There are numerous changes I plan on implementing before the final presentation next week.  First and foremost, I plan on completing the data visualizations in ArcGIS that I was unable to publish and complete due to technical errors.  Furthermore, I plan on taking the comments above and trying to reformat some of the visualizations to get a better variety.  One thing that I started thinking about in terms of income was reformatting it to include fewer income groups or even use pop out statistics to show the contrast.  It's definitely something I want to play around with more to see what makes more sense.

Additionally, I want to include more data visualization on the impact of this connectivity divide.  Based on the takeaways my interviewees brought up, I can tell I need to make the message more persuasive and memorable that the racial and socioeconomic gaps due to Covid will only exacerbate the exisiting gaps between these groups of students.

Lastly, I need to work on my citations and finish creating a strong narrative that matches the data and assists in the creation of the story to help readers take home those most critical points and draw them to my call to action.
