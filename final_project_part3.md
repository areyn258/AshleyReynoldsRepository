# Final Project Overview

## Changes Since Part Two

Since part two, I've been able to make some adjustments to my project.  One area of feedback I received from my interviewees last time was that the audience appeared to be people with money who could fix the problem.  That caused me to go back and reevaluate the language I was using throughout the sections and bring it down to a more parent or community member level instead of richer business people, organziations, or politicians.  

I also had the luxury of having time to work on the project after my presentation.  During the presentation, one of my graphics was called out for not being an original or recreated work by me.  I originally included the graphic in the presentation because I couldn't figure out a way to redesign the data to tell as powerful of a story as the visualization I found.  I didn't have access to the full data set due to the fact that the data was still new and a formal data request was required. The feedback from the presentation forced me to think more deeply about ways to reenvision that data, however, which led me to the creation of the hunger graphic included in the updated presentation.  

While I still feel frustrated because my visualization is not as powerful as the one that I found, I recognize the importance of recreating the visualization and making it my own work.  It was a meaningful lesson and I was grateful for the feedback that forced me to think more creatively - even if the result was not 100% what I hoped. 

## Updated GitHub Repository
