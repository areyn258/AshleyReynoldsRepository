# Assignment 3 & 4 

# Examination of Racial Disparities in Cleveland Evictions (2020)

For this assignment, I located the following image from the Eviction Lab, based out of Princeton University.

As you can see in the image, the data shows the number of eviction filings by racial makeup in 2020 so far.  As someone who is very interested in housing and eviction policy, I wanted to take a deeper look at a city I love.  I lived in Cleveland for three years where I taught K-12 before coming to Heinz.  There are a number of racial challenges in the city of Cleveland, and, as this data is trying to show, evictions is one of them.  

My original thoughts after looking at the data shown in this original visualization were that there was almost too much going on.  The story that the data was presenting was a stark and serious example of racial bias in public policy and the dozens of bars on this chart were taking away from that message.  To address these concerns, I knew, off the bat, that I wanted to address the amount of items on the chart and try to minimize space used to really hone in on the story.  

After a quick sketch, this is what I came up with as sort of a rough draft to see if my ideas were making sense to a larger audience.  One of the key things I wanted to do was expand the amount of peoople that were able to understand the racial divide here.

At the bottom of the page, you can see some of the feedback that I recieved from one of my reviewers.  My first reviewer, someone completely unfamiliar with data visualization or my topic was able to figure out that the topic was evictions and that they noticed there was a big orange chunk in that first colored in bar, which correlated with lots of Black tenants being evicted.  My second reviewer was someone else from Heinz, much more familiar with data visualization.  His responses are on the page.  

One interesting note that he brought up, which I had not previously thought about, was the idea of what I wanted the intended audience to learn.  I had been working under the assumption that what I wanted them to learn was obvious and the only lesson that could be gleaned from this data.  However, he brougt up a good point that if the story I wanted to tell was which months had the highest rates of evictions, I could reorder the months on the side from largest totals to smallest, forgoing chronology.  He also pointed out that I could create four separate graphs, one per racial group, that showed trends in which months they experienced the highest rates of eviction.  While these were both very valid and intersting points to ponder, after much consideration, I decided that the most important story to tell was the proportional discrimination by race in the data.  Therefore, I decided to keep the months chronologial and the data all on one graph.

After that feedback and discussion, I moved the data over to Flourish to begin my data visualization process.  Once I got the data situated in the proper format, I began working on the color palette.  I did intentionally choose this color palette, as it represents the data in a very logical manner.  That takes some of the cognitive load off of the reader and allows them to focus on the fact that the bars representing Black tenants are much larger across nearly all months of 2020 in Cleveland. 

Here is my final visualization.
